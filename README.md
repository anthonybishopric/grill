#Grill: Genetic Algorithms for Grid Coloring

Ever wonder how to fill a grid in efficiently and randomly? Grill takes hash values and algorithms and makes them compete for speed and randomness in filling a grid. 

Array-based shuffling algorithms [work well](blog.codinghorror.com/shuffling/) but take a lot of space. This project intends to to fill a grid without needing an NxM array.
